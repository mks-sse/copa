## Ways to connect to Buildkit
> [!NOTE]
Custom Buildkit connection to patch local or private images is only available with Copa-Action versions 0.6.1 and later. For all earlier Copa-Action versions, Buildkit in a container is the default approach, and a version must be supplied as input.

### Option 1: Connect to buildx instance (default)
By default, Copa Action creates its own Buildx instance to connect to for patching public and private images.

### Option 2: Connect using defaults through a custom socket
To patch local images, `copa` is limited to using `docker`'s built-in buildkit service, and must use the [`containerd image store`](https://docs.docker.com/storage/containerd/) feature. To enable this in your Github workflow, use `ghaction-setup-docker`'s [daemon-configuration](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-setup-docker#daemon-configuration) to set `"containerd-snapshotter": true`.

Example:
``` yaml
    - name: Set up Docker
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-setup-docker@v3
        with:
        daemon-config: |
            {
            "debug": true,
            "experimental": true,
                "features": {
                "containerd-snapshotter": true
                }
            }
    - name: Get socket path
        run: |
            url=$(docker context inspect | jq -r .[0].Endpoints.docker.Host)
            socket_path=$(echo "$url" | awk -F// '{print $2}')
            echo "$socket_path"
            echo "SOCKET=$socket_path" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

Then, supply the resulting socket path (`$SOCKET`) as the input `custom-socket` for the Copa Action to connect to.
> [!NOTE]
> Copa Action will load the image to the default docker context, not the "setup-docker-action" context.

### Option 3: Buildkit in a container
To connect via buildkit in a container, provide the input `buildkit-version`. Copa Action will create a buildkit container with that version to connect to.
> [!NOTE]
> This approach does not allow for patching of local or private images.
